# SKROT-NAV
A navigation system for a debris-collecting spacecraft, placed in a simulated earth orbit with the idea of being able to be used in real space. This code is part of my upper secondary school graduation project.

### How to use
Some of the code is meant to be reimplemented when the code is used in real space, eg. device-simulations used to demonstrate and test the program.
