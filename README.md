# SKROT-NAV

Part of my high school graduation project.

A navigationsystem for a debris-collecting spacecraft with device interaction, placed in a simulated earth orbit but hopefully able to be applied in real space.

### Project structure:
 - **Simulated space**
 - **Navigationsystem** 
    -  Deivce interaction


### How to use
Some of the code is meant to be reimplemented when the code is used in real space, eg. device-simulations used to demonstrate and test the program.


## Navigation System

Flight path control, object detection and communication.


## Space Simulation

Eulers stepmethod is the main method used for simulating gravitation for orbit (and collision).
