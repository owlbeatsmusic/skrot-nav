# SKROT-NAV

Part of my high school graduation project.

A navigationsystem for a debris-collecting spacecraft with device interaction, placed in a simulated earth orbit but hopefully able to be applied in real space.


### Main Project structure:
 - **Engine**
    -  space
    -  renderer
 - **Navigationsystem**
    -  core
    -  communcation
    -  devices
    -  flight_path
    -  position


### How to use
Some of the code is meant to be reimplemented when the code is used in real space, eg. device-simulations used to demonstrate and test the program.


## Navigation System

The main system is divded into 


## Space Simulation

Eulers method is the main method used for simulating gravitation for orbit (and collision).
